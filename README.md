# Physics Informed Neural Networks

These represent a transformative synergy between machine learning and physical modeling, enabling the integration of fundamental scientific principles (e.g., partial differential equations, conservation laws) directly into neural network architectures. By embedding governing equations of physical systems into the loss function during training, PINNs enforce physical consistency while learning from sparse or noisy data. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data-driven methods and traditional numerical simulations, offering a powerful framework for solving forward and inverse problems in complex systems where data is limited or expensive to acquire.
